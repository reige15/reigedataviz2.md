### Assignment 3 & 4
At a minimum, this portion of your portfolio should all the items mentioned in the instructions (a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)

Verify your public portfolio page is loading correctly and you are satisfied with your project.  Post your publicly-accessible link to the portfolio here when you're ready, and you're done!



## Step 1:Original Data Visualization
When looking for a data visualization I first started looking at the NYT and the Economist and CMS because those are the three websites where I personally look at data the most. When looking at fast facts, I found that there were a lot of many good charts and then found this one that was not terrible but could be improved. I felt that this specific chart was a bit confusing and misleading in the amount of money that is actually being spent. I finally decided on this visulization

## Step 2:The Process
Once I decided on this data visualization to critique and redo, I took the data out of the chart and put it into an excel file for easy upload into Tableau and Flourish. Within the critique however, I was able to learn that this chart was not terrible, just not the best way to portray the data for the reader. Mostly, I learned that I wanted to move away from a pie chart to display data that wasn't part of a whole in terms of showing proportions of the data. I understood what CMS was trying and going for, but what was accomplished at first glance was confusing and the colors were not helpful in understanding what was going on. Additionally, the critique validated how hard the visualization process can be sometimes, and I found myself being critical of things that are not easy to change or are hard to get around with your audience, like language. 

Additionally, I added a calculated for the percent of the total amount the type of service was from the total  medicaid payments (in Billions) for fiscal year 2014. I thought this would better convey what the chart was trying to show, not just as slices of pie, but as vast amounts of money taken from the overall billions of dollars going towards medical services. Below is a screenshot of the data.

Additionally, I started thinking how I wanted the wireframe to look. I played around in both Basalmiq and Infogram just to get a better idea of what I wanted to do for step 3. 



## Step 3:Summary of my Wireframe and Peer Feedback
While playing around in Basalmiq and Infogram I came up with two similar charts, one with bars and a chart below and one with just a chart and an area to call out main topics. Below are the pictures of both:

![Infogram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73552628/99433667-cc91fb00-28db-11eb-8c20-2a12c45dfb41.png)

After showing and talking through my ideas with both Julie and Nick I was able to see that the idea of a histogram with the addition of a chart would most likely be best to show the information best. We also discussed adding in colors, as with Basalmiq there are no colors. Basalmiq did have the best set up for the most information and I wanted to have a chart of some sort along with the histogram. 

Then I began to try and build out what I wanted in both Flourish and Tableau. 
First I began in Tableau and got dicouraged, so I moved over to Flourish. I wanted to add a chart to the graph as well and could not figure out in flourish, which left me with just this: 
<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/642626"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Which I liked but felt like it was a little chaotic and did not accomplish what I had set out in the wireframe originally. 

Finally I moved over to Tableau and played around with a few things, but ultimately decided on a small dashboard/wireframe pictured below for my final version. Within my final I found the chart of data to actually add confusion, and ended up taking it out at the last minute becuase of the confusion and contrasting colors as you can see here:

## Final Version

Why I selected this dataviz vs the original? 

I could not figure out how to get the direct dashboard onto github, but I thought this showed the proportions broken out better than the orginal and was more colorful in meaningful ways. I decided on this data visualization, because it had the ability to show a few things all at once, unlike the pie chart. I did not have to worry about doing the math for the percentages, as it was done for me and for the audience. Additionally, I felt the colors here were less contrasting than in the original pie chart. I tried really hard to make the chart more appealing and less like an old school report. I wanted to try and keep the reader interested and have big information be shown at first glance, but also have insights shown the third or fourth time a viewer looked at it. Throughout this process, I was also able to learn the strenghts and weakness of each tool which was nice for future use.
