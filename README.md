### Assignment 3 & 4
At a minimum, this portion of your portfolio should all the items mentioned in the instructions (a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)

Verify your public portfolio page is loading correctly and you are satisfied with your project.  Post your publicly-accessible link to the portfolio here when you're ready, and you're done!



## Step 1:Original Data Visualization
When looking for a data visualization I first started looking at the NYT and the Economist and CMS because those are the three websites where I personally look at data the most. When looking at fast facts, I found that there were a lot of many good charts and then found this one that was not terrible but could be improved. I felt that this specific chart was a bit confusing and misleading in the amount of money that is actually being spent. I finally decided on this visulization

## Step 2:The Process
Once I decided on this data visualization to critique and redo, I took the data out of the chart and put it into an excel file for easy upload into Tableau and Flourish. Additionally, I added a calculated for the percent of the total amount the type of service was from the total  medicaid payments (in Billions) for fiscal year 2014. I thought this would better convey what the chart was trying to show, not just as slices of pie, but as vast amounts of money taken from the overall billions of dollars going towards medical services. Below is a screenshot of the data.

Additionally, I started thinking how I wanted the wireframe to look. I played around in both Basalmiq and Infogram just to get a better idea of what I wanted to do for step 3. 



## Step 3:Summary of my Wireframe and Peer Feedback
While playing around in Basalmiq and Infogram I came up with two similar charts, one with bars and a chart below and one with just a chart and an area to call out main topics. Below are the pictures of both:
